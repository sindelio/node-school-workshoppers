# node_school_workshoppers

These are my solutions for the core NodeSchool workshoppers and a few of the electives. These workshoppers emphasize on learning the Node.JS programming language in an active learning process, by writing and testing code.

All **core** workshoppers were studied:

- learnyounode (Node.JS) 
- javascripting (JavaScript)
- learnyouhtml (HTML)
- git-it (Git and Github)
- how-to-npm (Node Package Manager)
- how-to-markdown (Markdown language)
- elementary-electron (Electron framework used to make applications with Node.JS)
- stream-adventure (streams and pipes in Node.JS)

The **elective** workshoppers studied were:

- bug-clinic (Debugging in Node.JS)
- scope-chains-closures (scopes, chains and closures in Node.JS)
- learnyoubash (BASH command interpreter)
- promise-it-wont-hurt (Promises in JavaScript)
- planetptroto (Prototypes in javaScript)
- expressworks (Express server framework for Node.JS)
- learnyoureact (coming soon!) (React framework used for server side rendering in Node.JS)

### Note
Among my solutions for the workshoppers there are some of the official solutions because they were much better than mine at the time. Also, the git-it and the how-to-npm workshoppers are done in a GUI (Graphical User Interface), so there's no code for those. I took screenshots of their completed state as proof of finishing them.
