# node_school_workshoppers

These are my solutions for the core NodeSchool workshoppers and a few of the electives. These workshoppers emphasize on learning the Node.js programming language in an active learning process, by writing and testing code.

The **core** workshoppers studied were:

- learnyounode (basic Node.js) 
- javascripting (Javascript)
- git-it (Git and Github)
- how-to-npm (Node Package Manager)
- how-to-markdown (Markdown language)
- learnyouhtml (HTML)
- elementary-electron (Electron framework for Node.js)
- stream-adventure (streams and pipes in Node.js)
- scope-chains-closures (scopes, chains and closures in Node.js)

The **elective** workshoppers studied were:

- learnyoubash (BASH command interpreter)
- expressworks (Express framework for Node.js)

### Note
Among my solutions for the stream-adventure tutorial there are some of the official solutions because they were much better than mine at the time.
