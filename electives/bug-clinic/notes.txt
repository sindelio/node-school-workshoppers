Important debugging techniques:

1. Monitoring/Logging facilities (Winston, Bunyan)
2. Static code analysis tools (ESLint, JSHint)
3. Automated tests (Jest, Mocha)
4. Interactive REPLs (Terminals)
5. Informative stack traces, both static and dynamic (modules?)
6. Scanners for complete status reports (NODE_DEBUG)
7. Debuggers for step-by-step execution (Built-ins)

Automated diagnostic tools for JS: 
	ESLint (seems better than JSHINT)
		- Can create a config file with the --init command
		- Rules are fully customizable
	JSHint
		- Probably can create a config file as well
		- Probably rules are customizable
